# AI-DRIVEN-TEA-QUALITY-AND-PRODUCTION-IMPROVEMENTS-IN-MID-COUNTRY-SRI-LANKA

This project deploys a comprehensive AI system to modernize the entire tea supply chain in Mid-Country Sri Lanka. By integrating advanced machine learning and vision models, the system drives significant improvements in quality, efficiency, and profitability from the leaf to the market.

***

## System Architecture
The proposed architecture is centered around four specialized, interconnected AI components:

### 1. Automated Tea Leaf Grading & Inspection 🌿
Uses machine vision and deep learning models to classify leaf quality and freshness in real-time, ensuring consistent adherence to high standards and reducing manual errors and subjectivity.

### 2. AI-Based Detection of Tea Plant Diseases 🐛
A deep learning system analyzes leaf imagery to identify pests, diseases (e.g., blister blight), and invasive species early. It provides instant alerts for timely intervention, reducing crop damage and improving plantation health.

### 3. Predictive Analytics for Crop Yield 📈
ML models analyze historical and environmental data (rainfall, temperature) to generate accurate production forecasts. This allows factories to optimize harvesting schedules and resource allocation.

### 4. Tea Market Demand Prediction 💰
Employs time-series forecasting on auction data to predict market demand and price trends, enabling smarter supply planning and maximizing auction revenue.
